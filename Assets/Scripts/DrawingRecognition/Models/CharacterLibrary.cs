/*
A CharacterLibrary stores a list of Characters, and handles comparison calculations of input bitmaps to the bitmaps of its stored characters
    - By default, a character library contains an "Empty" character (added during initialization)
    - Also contains weights for each comparison method, set by drawingRecognition during Awake()/Runtime.
*/

/*
****Public Interface

**Constructors:

CharacterLibrary(string name)
    - Initializes a new CharacterLibrary with a given name. Contains 1 empty character by default.


**Instance Variables:

string name
    - The name of this CharacterLibrary, used for identification.

List<Character> characterList
    - The list of Characters stored in this library.

double horizontalMapWeight, verticalMapWeight, circleMapWeight, gridMapWeight:
    - Weights applied to each map representation score when calculating an overall comparison score.


**Methods:

void AddCharacter(Character character)
    - Adds a character to the character list.
    - If a character with the same name exists in this library, it is replaced with the new character.

void RemoveCharacter(Character character)
    - Removes the specified character from this library, if it exists.

void RemoveCharacter(string charName)
    - Removes a character from this library by string name lookup, if the name exists.

void ClearLibrary()
    - Clears all characters from this library.


KeyValuePair<Character, double> GetMatch(Bitmap bitmap)
    - Returns the closest character match to a given bitmap and its comparison score.

List<KeyValuePair<Character, double>> GetMatchList(Bitmap bitmap)
    - Returns a list of all character comparison scores.
    - List is sorted from lowest scores -> highest, where a lower score means a closer match.


double CompareCharacters(string char1Name, string char2Name)
    - Returns the comparison score of 2 characters within this library.
    - Unused in my current implementation; could be useful for cross-comparison of values to optimize weight values.

void SetWeights(double circleMapWeight, double gridMapWeight, double horizontalMapWeight, double verticalMapWeight)
    - Sets the weight values used by this library in comparisons.
    - Recommended to keep weight vals as {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0} across all libs, but it is possible to set different weights for each library.
